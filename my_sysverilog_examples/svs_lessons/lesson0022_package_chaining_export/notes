1. comment
   items are imported so that they can be used immediately in whatever is being compiled
   some folks advocate NOT doing wildcard imports (a la  import twig_pkg::*;, but each thing explictly)

2. code change
   once items are compiled into their package (ex: twig_pkg::* is in branch_pkg, then you can use them)
   action: add  chained calls to functions up the packages.   then comment them out

3. code change
   action: try to call method from a package that is not directly imported.  it FAILS as expected
   
3. question
   what does it mean to move the imports in the packages from inside to outside?   what wrt scope?
   result:  w/ irun, it allows the method that is not directly imported to be called.   Why?
