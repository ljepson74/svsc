Title       : Transfer structure
Project     : XBus UVC
Created     : 2008
Description : This file declares the base struct that represents a single
            : transfer on the bus.
Notes       : The addr, read_write and data fields are marked as physical
            : fields (with a % symbol). These fields are not used for
            : packing in this UVC and so the % symbols are not required.
            : However, marking these fields as such indicates that these
            : are the fields that are physically driven to the DUT. It
            : also facilitates the use of the deep_compare_physical()
            : method, should the user need to do so.
