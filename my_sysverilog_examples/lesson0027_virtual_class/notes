VIRTUAL CLASS
1
make virtual class (with simple function)
make top and instantiate it.  you cannot.  error

2
extend virtual class
instantiate in top. you can

rule: virtual classes are not to be used, they are only to be extended.  that is all it means


MAKE CLASS NON-VIRTUAL AND NOW WORK WITH 
VIRTUAL METHODS (I believe the 2 are 100% independent)
3.make function in base class virtual and use it

4.make overriding function in extended class and use it

5.change the function prototype in extended class and it will ERROR
rule: a virtual method May or May Not be overridded.  as you wish.

Pure virtual method
6. remove the guts of base class virtual method. don't override it.  
it still runs.
maybe developer REQUIRED that whomeever extends it, does msthg with it.
instead of doing above...

7. make it pure virtual  //i.e. it must be implemented
run.  error.   class must be abstract. i.e. virtual
8. make class virtual
